# Voice Based home automation system

This project is all about accessing our home devices using the owner's voice itself. This technology will help the old age and disabled peoples who cant reach to the switch board. We are inmplimanting speaker recognition and speech recognition at the same instance so that the user will get varified only at the time when he speaks. Using this technology, we are providing better security to the existing systems so that it can't be accessed by any unauthorised user.Also, we are reducing the computation but decreasing the complexity of user authentication and then command processing separately.
